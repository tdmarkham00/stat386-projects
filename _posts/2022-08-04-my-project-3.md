# Introduction
In today's world, we have access to limitless amounts of data. Data professionals have the responsibility of turning data into information that is usable and informative. There are two key words from the previous sentence that are important to highlight: usable and informative. This post will focus on EDA, which are steps that should be followed to make data usable and presentable, namely the EDA process. As an example, we will use data from the [IMDb Top 250 list](https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/), which was gathered in a [previous post](https://tdmarkham00.github.io/stat386-projects/2022/10/18/web-scraping.html). Similar to the last post, it is possible to follow along with the python notebook in [this repository](https://github.com/tdmarkham00/imdb-top250).

## What is EDA?
EDA stands for exploratory data analysis, which is the next step in the data analytics process after retrieving your data. The aim of EDA is to better understand our data and prepare it for more sophisticated analysis. EDA is extremely important because it is sort of the last line of defense against "garbage in, garbage out", meaning that this is our chance to catch any errors or inconsistencies in the data before it is used for more inferential statistics.

## Using EDA to understand the data
Just for a moment, think of the analytics process as building a house.

Pictured above are some materials that can be used to build a house. To people who are unfamiliar with construction, these raw materials don't really do much good other. Data can be compared to the raw materials in this case. Even with data provided and a question to be answered, it's very difficult to build something without first understanding what you have and how it works. Similar to how a contractor would want to know that their tools work properly, or that they have the correct materials, those working with data need to ensure that they have the best data for the problem. During EDA, we're essentially in between the process of sourcing materials and actually building our figurative home.

## EDA for IMDb Top 250
In a previous post, we sourced our materials needed for our project. The materials are data about the IMDb Top 250 movies. Before any sort of building begins, it's time to understand this data and make sure that it makes sense. Checking out the shape of the data and looking for things like NA values or duplicate rows is a good start.

### Verify that the data was properly sourced
Let's start by checking the shape of our data.

As expected, we have the correct shape of data, so that looks good. It would be wise also to check for NA values and duplicates. We can see a count of NA values by column as such:

Note that Rating, Director, Score, and BoxOffice all have at least one NA value. The BoxOffice column doesn't bother me too much, because there are a lot of older movies that don't have any BoxOffice numbers. The other columns are a bit more concerning, and should be investigated. After some investigation, I was able to identify that there was an issue in how the IMDb list was scraped. There were movies that needed a '.' somewhere or another in their title that were removed as part of the scraping process. This caused the titles to be incorrectly submitted to the OMDb API and returned incorrect results. After modifying the scraping tool, better results were obtained.

Also note that the BoxOffice variable is an object, so let's remove those characters and convert into a numeric
```
for char in [',', '$']:
    top250['BoxOffice'] = top250['BoxOffice'].str.replace(char, '') 

top250['BoxOffice'] = top250['BoxOffice'].astype(float)
```
As part of understanding and cleaning the data, it can be important to do things like remove outliers or select a subset of variables, but that won't be necessary here. We're also going to leave the NA values as is, but those are things you would need to consider as well when working with your own data.

Now that we understand our variables a bit better and have ensured that the data is clean. Let's explore some relationships between different variables.
